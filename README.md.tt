# <%= app_name %>

This is a Rails <%= Rails::VERSION::MAJOR %> app created using [modern-rails-template][]. Please check README of the template repository to see the features available out of the box. To have a look to the new features introduced by Rails 5.2 (credentials for example), check this [article][].

## How to use this project

* We advise you to use [overmind][] to launch your processes in development. You just need to run `overmind s -f Procfile.dev`. Of course, another process manager, like [foreman][], would work too.
* We advise you to deploy to [Heroku][]. Do not forget to add the [Redis] add-on.
